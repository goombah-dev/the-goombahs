      title: `1. Introduction to the Goombahs`,
      text: `The Crypto Goombahs is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Ethereum network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as the Goombah smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.
      The collection will have a total of 7,500 Goombahs across the 5 families. Each family will consist of 1,500 Dons, Capos, Consigliere, and Associates that are linked to their respective families. This is only the first step for the Goombahs as we have more planned for the near future and look forward to going through the entire experience with all of you.
      This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Goombah digital collectibles.

When it comes to limiting commercial rights, however, we want you as an NFT holder to realize that you may use the Goombah image in its fullness only! The individual layered files and traits are proprietary and are our own creations. We don’t want to see any other projects utilizing our individually crafted layers, so we are not open to you minting new NFTs that are derivatives of our project, changing the original Goombah, or minting another full project using our Goombah in any way. Other than that, you can create whatever merchandise you would like up to
      $10,000 USD and should you approach that number or expect to go beyond it please reach out to the team at marketing@thegoombahs.io and we’ll discuss a potential licensing deal for anything beyond that amount. To limit the use even on merchandise, the user shall not use any Goombahs Licensed Materials in connection with any material, which is unlawful, fraudulent, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, profane, threatening, abusive, hateful, offensive or otherwise objectionable or unreasonable or infringing upon any laws or regulations or intellectual property rights or proprietary rights or confidentiality obligations and you shall indemnify and defend FAL Consulting, LLC. against any claims, damages, proceedings, loss or costs arising from such use.

However, the landscape around NFTs, DAOs, and various other things we are hoping to do is shifting and legally gray in many ways. When you purchase your Goombah, you agree that your purchase from our initial launch of NFTs is all you are guaranteed to receive in exchange for your funds.
      Whether through primary or secondary channels, the art is what you receive. Any future benefits are ancillary to this purchase and not to be taken into consideration with your initial purchase.

We make absolutely no promise or guarantee that these NFTs will be worth anything more than what you and the market deem the art to be worth. This could very well be zero. We give you our word that we are working to build a community and bring as much intangible value to the project as we can! You understand that they have no inherent monetary value, and they should be treated as nothing more than a collectible with potential future value or lack thereof.`,
